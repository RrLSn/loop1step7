                <p><span>T</span>he desire to be respected by somone of the opposite sex is something that run deep in everyone, even tho most people don't take the time to find somone who truly respects them. It seems people are just looking for somone to show them the slightest amount of attention, settling for something much less than respect. I am conviced one of the ways to help any relationship grow is by showing respect.</p>
            <p>I have come to the conclusion that everyone longs to be respected. which respect? Respect is showing someone extra special attention, or high regard, based on the desire to show them how highly they are valued</p>
